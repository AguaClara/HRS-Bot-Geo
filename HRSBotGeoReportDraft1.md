##Introduction
Sedimentation is a crucial part of a water filtration plants as it acts as the major removal method for suspended and coagulated minerals, dirt and particles. Through various experiments and observations in plants, the AguaClara Cornell team has learnt about the importance of a floc blanket in a sedimentation tank.

A floc blanket is a dense layer of suspended flocs which allows particulates which have not coagulated, or coagulated particulates too small to settle, to attach onto the flocs which can be removed. Hence, vastly improving the efficiency and performance of a water treatment plant.

However, in the AguaClara lab, the floc blanket would initially form but would decay with time. Thus, the performance of the system drastically decreased. After discussions regarding the differences between the design of the sedimentation tanks in the plants and in the lab, the High Rate Sedimentation-Bottom Geometry team was created to determine the optimal shape of the input of water into the sedimentation tubes in the lab to ensure the consistent formation of a stable floc blankets.

##Literature Review
Over the summer of 2018, the AguaClara High Rate Sedimentation team conducted various experiments comparing the formation and stability of floc blankets when altering the up-flow velocity and coagulant doses. The experiments yielded several conclusions:
 * The ideal up flow velocity for the creation of a floc blanket is 3mm/s
 * The reason for the floc decay is most probably caused by the inefficient recycling of flocs which have settled
 * A symmetrical conical settler at the input of water produced a floc blanket which is more stable than without the settler, but still decayed with time. It also results in a large buildup of flocs.
 * An asymmetrical steep slope produced a stable floc blanket with no floc buildup. However, fabrication of this is impractical to be applied to all current and future systems.

##Objectives
Reading through the results and conclusions drawn by the High Rate Sedimentation Summer 2018 team, the objective of the Bottom Geometry team is to redesign the bottom geometry of the input of water into the sedimentation tube which:
 * Creates a stable floc blanket.
 * Does not allow for the build up of flocs.
 * Is easily fabricated.
 * Can easily be integrated into existing and future systems.
